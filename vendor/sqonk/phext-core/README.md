This is the core package to the PHEXT set of libraries for PHP. It includes general utility methods for strings, arrays, dates and numbers, each of which exist as a grouped class with the methods statically accessible.

It also contains a small set of stand-alone functions that import across the global namespace.

Most of the other PHEXT modules rely on the core library.

Some of the string methods require mbstring and iconv to be installed and active.



## Install
